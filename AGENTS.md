# Cal.diy Development Guide for AI Agents

You are a senior Cal.diy engineer working in a Yarn/Turbo monorepo. You prioritize type safety, security, and small, reviewable diffs.

## Do

- Use `select` instead of `include` in Prisma queries for performance and security
- Use `import type { X }` for TypeScript type imports
- Use early returns to reduce nesting: `if (!booking) return null;`
- Use `ErrorWithCode` for errors in non-tRPC files (services, repositories, utilities); use `TRPCError` only in tRPC routers
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`
- Create PRs in draft mode by default
- Run `yarn type-check:ci --force` before concluding CI failures are unrelated to your changes
- Import directly from source files, not barrel files (e.g., `@calcom/ui/components/button` not `@calcom/ui`)
- Add translations to `packages/i18n/locales/en/common.json` for all UI strings
- Use `date-fns` or native `Date` instead of Day.js when timezone awareness isn't needed
- Put permission checks in `page.tsx`, never in `layout.tsx`
- Use `ast-grep` for searching if available; otherwise use `rg` (ripgrep), then fall back to `grep`
- Use Biome for formatting and linting
- Only add code comments that explain **why**, not **what** — see [code comment guidelines](agents/rules/quality-code-comments.md)


## Don't

- Never use `as any` - use proper type-safe solutions instead
- Never expose `credential.key` field in API responses or queries
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Never modify `*.generated.ts` files directly - they're created by app-store-cli
- Never put business logic in repositories - that belongs in Services
- Never use barrel imports from index.ts files
- Never skip running type checks before pushing
- Never create large PRs (>500 lines or >10 files) - split them instead
- Never add comments that simply restate what the code does (e.g., `// Get the user` above a `getUser()` call)

## PR Size Guidelines

Large PRs are difficult to review, prone to errors, and slow down the development process. Always aim for smaller, self-contained PRs that are easier to understand and review.

### Size Limits

- **Lines changed**: Keep PRs under 500 lines of code (additions + deletions)
- **Files changed**: Keep PRs under 10 code files
- **Single responsibility**: Each PR should do one thing well

**Note**: These limits apply to code files only. Non-code files like documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md), lock files (yarn.lock, package-lock.json), and auto-generated files are excluded from the count.

### How to Split Large Changes

When a task requires extensive changes, break it into multiple PRs:

1. **By layer**: Separate database/schema changes, backend logic, and frontend UI into different PRs
2. **By feature component**: Split a feature into its constituent parts (e.g., API endpoint PR, then UI PR, then integration PR)
3. **By refactor vs feature**: Do preparatory refactoring in a separate PR before adding new functionality
4. **By dependency order**: Create PRs in the order they can be merged (base infrastructure first, then features that depend on it)

### Examples of Good PR Splits

**Instead of one large "Add booking notifications" PR:**
- PR 1: Add notification preferences schema and migration
- PR 2: Add notification service and API endpoints
- PR 3: Add notification UI components
- PR 4: Integrate notifications into booking flow

**Instead of one large "Refactor calendar sync" PR:**
- PR 1: Extract calendar sync logic into dedicated service
- PR 2: Add new calendar provider abstraction
- PR 3: Migrate existing providers to new abstraction
- PR 4: Add new calendar provider support

### Benefits of Smaller PRs

- Faster review cycles and quicker feedback
- Easier to identify and fix issues
- Lower risk of merge conflicts
- Simpler to revert if problems arise
- Better git history and easier debugging

## Commands

See [agents/commands.md](agents/commands.md) for full reference. Key commands:

```bash
yarn type-check:ci --force  # Type check (always run before pushing)
yarn biome check --write .  # Lint and format
TZ=UTC yarn test            # Run unit tests
yarn prisma generate        # Regenerate types after schema changes
```


## What a green build does not prove

`yarn type-check:ci` and `./build.sh` both passing means the code is **valid**, not that it
**works**. Every defect in the schedule-locations feature passed both. On UI work, drive the
page — screenshot it, read the DOM — before reporting something as done.

The failure modes that keep recurring here, all of which compile and build cleanly:

- **Rendering outside the page shell.** `AvailabilitySettings` returns `<Shell>`, so anything
  rendered as its sibling lands outside the content area and appears under the nav. Components
  that own the shell need a slot prop, not a neighbour.
- **`hideWhenJustOneOption`.** The booking-page location field carries it, and
  `getBookingResponsesSchema` hides the field at one option or fewer. Narrowing options to one
  removes the field from the page entirely — and it never populates a value, so an empty
  `responses.location` falls through to the default conferencing app and books Cal Video.
- **Form fields pre-select their first option.** A pre-filled value is indistinguishable from a
  deliberate choice, so "only apply a default if the user has not chosen" never fires. Key such
  logic on what changed (the selected slot, say) instead.
- **Explicit Prisma selects.** `eventTypeRepository.findById` and `findByIdForOrgAdmin`
  enumerate every field the edit form needs. Adding a column to `schema.prisma` is not enough —
  a missing entry means the form silently reads the default and paints over the stored value.
- **Import paths that only the bundler checks.** `tsconfig` maps `@calcom/ui/*` onto source, but
  Turbopack honours the package `exports` map. A deep path such as
  `@calcom/ui/components/form/inputs/TextField` type-checks and fails the build. Check
  `packages/ui/package.json` `exports`, not the filesystem. A missing import (`classNames`) is
  likewise a build error, never a type error.
- **`packages/trpc` declarations are generated.** `packages/trpc/react/trpc.ts` imports
  `AppRouter` from the built `types/` directory, so adding a router or an input field needs
  `yarn workspace @calcom/trpc run build`. If that build no-ops, delete
  `packages/trpc/tsconfig.server.build.tsbuildinfo` — a stale cache makes it silently do nothing.
- **Regenerating Prisma during a type check.** Running `yarn prisma generate` while `tsc` is
  running produces phantom errors in unrelated files. Let one finish first.
- **Timezones.** A rule expressed in an organiser's schedule must be resolved in that schedule's
  timezone, never the server's or the booker's. Prisma returns `@db.Time` pinned to
  1970-01-01 UTC, so the wall clock lives in the UTC accessors; `@db.Date` compares on its UTC
  calendar date. `*.timezone.test.ts` files are re-run under several `TZ` values — put anything
  zone-sensitive there.
- **An event type usually has no schedule of its own.** `eventType.scheduleId` is commonly null
  and the owner's `defaultScheduleId` applies. Reading the `schedule` relation alone resolves
  nothing for those event types while looking entirely correct.
- **Empty strings are not null.** A `""` address reaching a matcher that branches on
  `!== null` compares an empty string against a real value and fails. Normalise to null on write.

## Boundaries

### Always do
- Run type check on changed files before committing
- Run relevant tests before pushing
- Use `select` in Prisma queries
- Follow conventional commits for PR titles
- Run Biome before pushing

### Ask first
- Adding new dependencies
- Schema changes to `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Changes affecting multiple packages
- Deleting files
- Running full build or E2E suites

### Never do
- Commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files
- Expose `credential.key` in any query
- Use `as any` type casting
- Force push or rebase shared branches
- Modify generated files directly

## Code Examples

### Good error handling

```typescript
// Good - Descriptive error with context
throw new Error(`Unable to create booking: User ${userId} has no available time slots for ${date}`);

// Bad - Generic error
throw new Error("Booking failed");
```

For which error class to use (`ErrorWithCode` vs `TRPCError`) and concrete examples, see [quality-error-handling](agents/rules/quality-error-handling.md).

### Good Prisma query

```typescript
// Good - Use select for performance and security
const booking = await prisma.booking.findFirst({
  select: {
    id: true,
    title: true,
    user: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        email: true,
      }
    }
  }
});

// Bad - Include fetches all fields including sensitive ones
const booking = await prisma.booking.findFirst({
  include: { user: true }
});
```

### Good imports

```typescript
// Good - Type imports and direct paths
import type { User } from "@prisma/client";
import { Button } from "@calcom/ui/components/button";

// Bad - Regular import for types, barrel imports
import { User } from "@prisma/client";
import { Button } from "@calcom/ui";
```

### API v2 Imports (apps/api/v2)

When importing from `@calcom/features` or `@calcom/trpc` into `apps/api/v2`, **do not import directly** because the API v2 app's `tsconfig.json` doesn't have path mappings for these modules, which causes "module not found" errors.

Instead, re-export from `packages/platform/libraries/index.ts` and import from `@calcom/platform-libraries`:

```typescript
// Step 1: In packages/platform/libraries/index.ts, add the export
export { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/features/profile/repositories/ProfileRepository";

// Step 2: In apps/api/v2, import from platform-libraries
import { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/platform-libraries";

// Bad - Direct import causes module not found error in apps/api/v2
import { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/features/profile/repositories/ProfileRepository";
```

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Title follows conventional commits: `feat(scope): description`
- [ ] Type check passes: `yarn type-check:ci --force`
- [ ] Lint passes: `yarn lint:fix`
- [ ] Relevant tests pass
- [ ] Diff is small and focused (<500 lines, <10 files)
- [ ] No secrets or API keys committed

- [ ] Created as draft PR

## When Stuck

- Ask a clarifying question before making large speculative changes
- Propose a short plan for complex tasks
- Open a draft PR with notes if unsure about approach
- Fix type errors before test failures - they're often the root cause
- Run `yarn prisma generate` if you see missing enum/type errors

## Spec-Driven Development (Opt-In)

For complex features, you can use spec-driven development when explicitly requested.

**To enable:** Tell the AI "use spec-driven development" or "follow the spec workflow"

See [SPEC-WORKFLOW.md](SPEC-WORKFLOW.md) for the full workflow documentation.
